URGENT:
-fix mountain 3 from left - edge to light in the night


NEXT UP:
-split background into separate objects (buildings mountains)
--add mechanism to handle dawns and shawns on buidings and mountains so further back objects lighten/darken sooner than more foreground obj
ects

LATER ON
-make new stars
-and slight  motion to stars
-SOUNDS to ticks
-improve animations of moon and sun movement(sprites??)



would be nice (maybe):
-add gradient/effects to shwan/dawn
-random clounds (night/day?)
